## How to write interactive Python documentation with Jupyter.
### The Jupyter Project
As stated on the [Jupyter Project](http://jupyter.org "Jupyter Project") site: 

> The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.

Before you continue you should [download and install](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html "Download and install the Jupyter Notebook") the Jupyter Notebook. 

However, if you just want to play along with the exmples go to the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org "Jupyter Notebook Viewer"), and enter the url to one of the notebooks (they will have the _.ipynb_ extension): e.g.: [1. A Brief Introduction to Python.ipynb](https://github.com/musicus/mango-chicken-fish/blob/master/1.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Python.ipynb) (if you just want to copy/paste the link: https://github.com/musicus/mango-chicken-fish/blob/master/1.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction%20to%20Python.ipynb).
